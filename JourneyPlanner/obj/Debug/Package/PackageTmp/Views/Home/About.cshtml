    <p>
        Our group decided to approach this assignment by building a web application in ASP.NET
        MVC4 and C#.
        <br />
        <br />
        The features that the requirements specified seemed to naturally suit a web application.
        For example, using the Google Maps API would satisfy the GPS and distance requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, a web application has the benefits of cross-platform accessibility
        (including mobile) which our group felt would be very important to the users of
        this application.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Data</h3>
    <p>
        All the data that is so far available has been sourced from <a href="http://ptv.vic.gov.au/">
            Public Transport Victoria</a>. You can read more about our scraping process
        @Html.ActionLink("here", "Scraper", "Scrape"). At the moment we have only sourced
        train timetables (city-bound) as per the assignment 3 requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most obvious and practical choice for storing our data was a database (MSSQL
        Server 2008). A database is efficient and reliable and gives our group, as developers,
        more flexibility in handling our data.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an overview of the initial schema we designed to hold the train timetable.
        <br />
        <img src="/Images/db-schema.png" style="width: 687px;" alt="schema">
        <br />
        We expect that as we begin to collect more data from different transport modes,
        our database schema will change.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Presentation</h3>
    <p>
        At the moment, our presentation is optimised to purely display the train timetable
        data we have collected. That is, we only expose particular values and don't allow
        user input. This is a deliberate decision for Assignment 3 and we expect that we
        will implement alternative presentations as we expose more functionality to the
        user over the course of the semester.
